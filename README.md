# Fullstack Academy Async Week Algorithms

This is the repo for Jasmin's 10:30am Async Algo sessions for the 2004 Cohort.

Each day I will add an additional algorithm problem and solution to this repo. **Only interviewers** will look at the solution file before we meet.

## Contents of the Solution File
- The algorithm prompt
- Some examples (these may be shared with the interviewee)
- Tips for the interviewee (these can be shared verbally as needed)
- At least two different solutions to the algorithm to showcase different approaches
- Worst case time and space complexity analysis

## The REACTO process
**R: Restate the problem** in your own words. Draw a diagram if helpful.

**E: Examples** Pick a few short examples that demonstrate the expected outcome of this algorithm, including edge cases.

**A: Approach** Talk through your intended approach to the problem. Mention time complexity and pros and cons of your approach, if you can. This step can include pseudocode. You want to reach the optimal approach in this step, before writing a single line of code.

**C: Code** Write some Javascript. Your brackets do not have to be perfect. More important is clearly articulating your approach and writing code to match.

**T: Test** Walk through your wonderful examples from Step "E" of REACTO. Maybe your code works for regular inputs but not edge cases. Act as a debugger and walk through your code to find any logic issues that may break your code.

**O:** Optimize. Talk about the optimization of your solution. Maybe you made a tradeoff on time and space. Explain that you understand this choice and why you made it.

## General Tips for a Smooth Mock Interview
### Interviewees (people solving the algorithm)
- Use repl.it to code
- Share your screen
- If you need visual examples, your interviewer can send them over slack
- Talk it out!! Even if you have no clue what's going on, talk through what you DO understand about the problem. The interviewer can help guide you, but they need you to verbalize your thoughts.
- If you can only think of the brute force solution, that's ok. Better to code something non-optimal than nothing at all.
### Interviewers (people conducting the interview)
- It's ok if there's some quiet time during the interview. Let the interviewee struggle a little bit with the problem before jumping in with hints
- If the interviewee is headed down a very wrong path, point our an example that demonstrates this for them
- If they start coding the brute force solution, stop them. Encourage them to think about other approaches that take less time or space. Only let them proceed if they cannot think of other approaches, or can clearly articulate why they are moving forward with their solution
